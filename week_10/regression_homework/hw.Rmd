```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(ggfortify)
```

```{r}
projects <- read_csv("week_10_hw_data/project_management.csv") %>% select(-X1)
```

```{r}
projects %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = actual_length, y = estimated_length)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
projects %>% 
  summarise(cor(actual_length, estimated_length))
```

As the r vaule is 0.805, it is very close to 1 and therefore indicates a strong correlation between actual job length and the estimated job time i.e as the the longer jobs were also esitmated to take longer.

```{r}
model <- lm(estimated_length ~ actual_length, data = projects)

model

tidy(model)

clean_names(glance(model))

projects %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = estimated_length, x = actual_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(
    intercept = model$coefficients,
    slope = model$coefficients
  )

autoplot(model)
```
